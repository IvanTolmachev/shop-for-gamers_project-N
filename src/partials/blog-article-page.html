      The very first step in this checklist is to decide if you want a pair of
      gaming headphones or a pair of gaming headsets.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-article-text comm-text">
      So what is the difference between gaming headphones and gaming headsets?
    </p>
    <p class="blog-article-text comm-text">
      Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic <br />Gaming
      headphones are regular headphones that are used traditionally for music
      enjoyment. However, they possess qualities that are awesome for gaming
      needs too. Audiophilic characteristics such as great micro-detail
      retrieval, accurate sound stage and immersive sound experience make them
      feasible to double up as a pair of gaming headphones.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-article-text comm-text">
      However, most audiophile headphones do not come with a mic nor do they
      have any mic attachment slots. You will need to get an external mic like
      the Blue Yeti X for communication support.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-article-text comm-text">
      A professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is Ninja, famous
      for streaming PUBG and Fortnight. He uses the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro with
      Audio Technica AT2035 Cardioid Condenser Microphone while streaming his
      games.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-article-text comm-text">
      There are several benefits and drawbacks to using a gaming headphones
      setup for gaming.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-article-text comm-text">
      Benefits of Gaming Headphones Higher upsides for audio and mic quality
      <br />As you have a wider product selection for both the headphones and
      mic itself, you are able to assemble your gaming setup with the latest mic
      and headphones. There is potential for better overall audio and microphone
      quality.
