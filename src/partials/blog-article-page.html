    The very first step in this checklist is to decide if you want a pair of
    gaming headphones or a pair of gaming headsets.

  <p class="blog-article-text comm-text">
    So what is the difference between gaming headphones and gaming headsets?
  </p>
  <p class="blog-article-text comm-text">
    Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic <br />Gaming
    headphones are regular headphones that are used traditionally for music
    enjoyment. However, they possess qualities that are awesome for gaming needs
    too. Audiophilic characteristics such as great micro-detail retrieval,
    accurate sound stage and immersive sound experience make them feasible to
    double up as a pair of gaming headphones.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-article-text comm-text">
    However, most audiophile headphones do not come with a mic nor do they have
    any mic attachment slots. You will need to get an external mic like the Blue
    Yeti X for communication support.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-article-text comm-text">
    A professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is Ninja, famous for
    streaming PUBG and Fortnight. He uses the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro with Audio
    Technica AT2035 Cardioid Condenser Microphone while streaming his games.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-article-text comm-text">
    There are several benefits and drawbacks to using a gaming headphones setup
    for gaming.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-article-text comm-text">
    Benefits of Gaming Headphones Higher upsides for audio and mic quality
    <br />As you have a wider product selection for both the headphones and mic
    itself, you are able to assemble your gaming setup with the latest mic and
    headphones. There is potential for better overall audio and microphone
    quality.
